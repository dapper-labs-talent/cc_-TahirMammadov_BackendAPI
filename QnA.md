How long did this assignment take?
> 3.5 hours

What was the hardest part?
> Implementing JWT verification and generation was relatively hard.

Did you learn anything new?
> Yes, I have never implemented JWT authentication in Go, learned how to generate and verify JWT tokens. Moreover, never used `ginkgo` and `gomega` libraries for testing. I really like how well unit tests can be structured using those libraries.

Is there anything you would have liked to implement but didn't have the time to?
> There were a few things I could have added to this project but the main thing I wanted to add but did not have time to was integration tests.

What are the security holes (if any) in your system? If there are any, how would you fix them?
> The main security hole is JWT key is hard coded. In real-world this can be part of k8s secret which is encrypted using Mozilla SOPS

Do you feel that your skills were well tested?
> Yes, this project basically tests how a developer thinks and how familiar he/she is with best practices.
